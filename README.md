# Note-Taker

## Description
 This Note Taker application allows the user to write and save notes. The front end was already created and I was tasked with the challenge of setting up the back end using Express.js to set up routes for the starter code to generate the app to Heroku. The routes that were set up allow the user to now enter notes and save them. When the user enters a new note it is written to the the db.json file effectively updating the list of current notes.

## What I Learned
  Creating this application, I learned how to set up the back end of an application. The different routes and paths that files are communicated to the front end allowing the application to run.
